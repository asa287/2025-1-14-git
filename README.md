my favorite food: pizza

 :O I'm using :pizza: (two : around the word 'pizza') in "git commit -m".."" to use an emoji üçï

- `git config pull.rebase false`: merge the conflict files
- (use `git add <file>...` to mark resolution)
- (use `git -commit -m"..."` to conclude the merge)

- `code .gitignore`: open this file in your vscode and type in the name of the file you want git to ignore.

- `mkdir <name>`: create a folder. This (an empty folder without created files) will be detected by terminal
- create a file called ".gitkeep" (manually), which help `git status` to trace the empty new-created folder with a red "img/" shown

- `git log`: see the local change history 
a ":" shows at the bottom, press "j"/"k" for scrolling up/down
press "q" to exit the git log
- `git log --oneline`: a more concise way to show the information
